# USE3-B Building of Parallel Programs
# Background
# Aim
# Outcomes
  * Build parallel programs, e.g. via open sources packages.
  * Run parallel programs in an HPC environment.
  * Use a compiler and to assess the effects of optimization switches available for the relevant compilers (e.g. GNU, Intel).
  * Use a linker and to assess the effects of linker specific options and environment variables (e.g. -L and LIBRARY_PATH, -rpath and LD_RUN_PATH).
  * Configure the relevant settings (e.g. by setting compiler and linker options), which determine how the application ought to be built with regard to the parallelization technique(s) used (e.g. OpenMP, MPI).
  * Use software building environments like make, Autotools, CMake.
