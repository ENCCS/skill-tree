# USE4-B Developing Parallel Programs
# Background

In HPC parallelization brings huge performance benefits and is omnipresent. That brings challenges when developing software. There are a lot of concepts that have to be considered to write parallel programs well.

# Aim
  * To enable practitioners to comprehend the concepts and procedures for developing parallel applications for HPC environments.
  * To debug and troubleshoot issues with parallel applications and parallelization.
  * To run and execute parallel applications on the HPC system.

# Outcomes
  * Develop parallel software.
  * Code parallel programs.
  * Debug parralel programs.
  * Articulate the problems of synchronization Issues like Race Conditions, Deadlocks
  * Back up your programming with an understanding of Amdahlâ€˜s Law
