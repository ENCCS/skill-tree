# USE1.4.1-B Overview
# Background

Understanding the general principles of a package manager is the foundation to utilize package managers.
The package manager provides a repository of software stored in a dedicated file system location -- even for different versions.
A specific software and version may depend on another software or libraries forming a tree of dependencies.
Software might be incompatible with another software, too.

The user can query available software via commands and loads software using a program of the package manager via the shell command line interface.
A package manager then makes it available by manipulating shell variables.
Understanding these variables helps to understand system behavior and to debug issues.

# Aim
  * To describe the principles of a package manager and how it interfaces with the shell.

# Outcomes
  * Describe the general dependency structure of software
  * Describe how a package manager makes software available
  * Using the export command to print shell variables
  * Understand shell variables relevant for executing software and for building software
    - PATH for executables
    - LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH for libraries
    - MANPATH for manual pages (man command)
    - PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH for pkg-config
  * Manipulate shell variables to include additional software
    - Setting shell variables for a single program by prefixing or by using export
