# USE1.4.2-B Environment Modules
# Background

The Environment Modules package is a widely used tool for managing information (modulefiles) about installed software.
It comes with integration into the shell.

# Aim
  * To be able to use the module command to load software.

# Outcomes
  * Comprehend that Modules can have dependencies and conflicts
    * a Module can enforce that other Modules that it depends on must be loaded before the Module itself can be loaded
    * conflicting modules must not be loaded at the same time (e.g. two version of a compiler)

  * Query information about packages
    - list
    - avail
    - whatis
    - search
    - display
    - help
  * Load/Unload software modules
    - load/unload
    - purge
    - swap
    - switch
  * Describe the MODULEPATH variable
