# USE1.5-B Remote Access
# Background

A HPC system is accessed remotely and has its own file systems that contain data and programs to execute.
Learning the ways of general interaction with the remote system and tools involved is essential for newcomers.

Users must connect to the system typically using the Secure Shell (ssh) which then starts a shell and allows for interactive access.
When the user disconnects such a session is terminated.
Starting of a server-sided session that persists after disconnection enables to execute long-running programs remotely and allows to seamlessly continue on a  previous session.
Data transfer between a users system (e.g., desktop or laptop) and remote system requires special tools and allows even for interactive access.

# Aim
  * To understand how to access a remote server and transfer data.

# Outcomes
  *  login remotely to cluster nodes using e.g. SSH with password or SSH key authentication
  *  access local and remote files in remote sessions
  * screen / tmux
  *  access local and remote files using enhanced features (e.g. via SSHFS) in remote sessions
