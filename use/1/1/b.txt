# USE1.1-B Command Line Interface
# Background
HPC systems are usually accessed via a Linux-based Command Line Interface (CLI) that is provided by a shell.
At its core, a shell is simply a convenient tool which you can use to execute commands on a Linux computer.
The shell provides a textual interface allowing to interact with the operating system and performing all possible operations, i.e., accessing and manipulating files and running programs.

Part of this module are the general principles of the interaction with a shell; they are illustrated on the widely available bash shell.

# Aim
  * To describe the key principles of a shell.
  * To execute basic programs and manipulate their input/output.

# Outcomes
  * Utilize the bash shell to execute individual programs with arguments
  * List the set of basic programs and their tasks:
    - pwd
    - whoami
    - sleep
    - kill
    - echo
    - clear
    - man
    - exit
  * Utilize the available help of a program (--help argument and the man pages)
  * Interrupt or abort a program execution
    - CTRL-C
    - CTRL-Z
    - using kill -9
  * Using the shell history to search and execute previous executed commands
  * Identify potential special characters that must be handled with care
  * Utilize escaping to ensure correct handling of arguments
  * Understand wildcard characters to select a group of files/directories
    - *
    - [,-]
