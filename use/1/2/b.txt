# USE1.2-B Shell Scripts
# Background

The shell provides a programming language that allows you to write programs (known as shell scripts) which allows to combine commands into more complex programs.

Despite initially seeming cumbersome and inefficient to many, the real power of shell scripting quickly becomes apparent to those who use it.
An everyday use is to automate repetitive tasks which would otherwise be time-consuming to complete.

# Aim

  * To automatize and bundle repetitive tasks in form of shell scripts.
  * To find and solve issues (``bugs'').
*  access local and remote files using enhanced features (e.g. via SSHFS) in remote sessions

  *  check disk quotas commonly used to limit the amount of disk space available for the user


# Outcomes
  *  use and write shell scripts
  *  use troubleshooting, e.g. to handle syntactic and logical errors in scripts
