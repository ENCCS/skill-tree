# USE1-B Cluster Operating System
# Background
HPC systems are usually accessed via a Linux-based Command Line Interface (CLI).
Via the CLI, users can run programs to manipulate files, load additional software, or execute programs.
While there are many similarities to single-user Linux systems, HPC systems differ widely in the management of provided Software packages and users must pay attention to the locality of data.

# Aim
To access and manipulate data, and to execute programs on a cluster environment.

# Outcomes
  * Describe the command line interface and the bash shell
  * Sketch the organization of the typical file system tree
  * Utilize basic tools to navigate and manage files
  * Describe package management tools that provide access to a rich variety of software
  * Use and write basic shell scripts, e.g., to automate the execution of several commands
  * Utilize tools to transfer data between a desktop/laptop system and a remote HPC system
