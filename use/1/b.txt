# USE1-B Cluster Operating System
# Background

HPC systems are usually accessed via a Linux-based Command Line Interface (CLI).
Via the CLI, users can run programs to manipulate files, load additional software, or execute programs.

While there are many similarities to single-user Linux systems, HPC systems differ widely in the management of provided Software packages, and users must pay attention to the locality of data.


# Aim
  * To remotely access and manipulate data.
  * To execute programs in a cluster environment.
  * To use and write shell scripts e.g. to automatically execute several commands in a row that otherwise would have to be entered manually one by one and to automate simple tasks
  * To select the right environment setting to build programs with the proper compiler, linker, and libraries versions or to run programs

# Outcomes
  * Describe the command line interface and the bash shell
  * Sketch the organization of the typical file system tree
  * Utilize essential tools to navigate and manage files
  * Utilize package management tools that provide access to a wide variety of software
  * Use and write basic shell scripts, e.g., to automate the execution of several commands
  * Utilize tools to transfer data between a desktop/laptop system and a remote HPC system
