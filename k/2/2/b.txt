# Background
# Aim
# Outcomes
  * Explain how performance bounds of the various components of the HPC system (e.g. CPU, caches, memory) can limit the overall performance of a parallel program.
  * Explain how performance bounds of the various components of the HPC system (e.g. network, I/O) can limit the overall performance of a parallel program.
