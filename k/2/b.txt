# K2-B Performance Modeling
# Background
  *  HPC systems are massively parallel and therefore sophisticated parallel programs are required to exploit their performance potential as much as possible, including but not limited to modeling the I/O performance.

# Aim
  * To provide knowledge how the performance of parallel programs may be assessed

# Outcomes
  *  How the performance of parallel programs may be assessed
