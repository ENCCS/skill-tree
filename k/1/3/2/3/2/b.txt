# K1.3.2.3.2-B Parallel file system
# Background
Parallel (or cluster) file systems are global file systems like distributed file systems, i.e. they can be used on any node in the cluster. 
They are designed to deliver high I/O bandwidth and provide large disk space.

# Aim

# Outcomes
  * Comprehend that the parallel or cluster aspect is twofold
    * Firstly, the hardware is parallel itself (the file system is provided by several servers that operate in a coordinated way)
    * Secondly, parallel I/O is enabled, i.e. more than one process can consistently write to the same file at the same time
