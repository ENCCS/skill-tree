# Outcomes
  *  parallelization techniques at the instruction level of a processing element (e.g. pipelining, SIMD processing)
  * advanced instruction sets that improve parallelization (e.g., AVX-512)
  *  hybrid approaches, e.g. combining CPUs with GPUs or FPGAs 
  *  typical network topologies and architectures used for HPC systems, like fat trees based on switched fabrics using e.g. fast Ethernet (1 or 10 Gbit) or InfiniBand
