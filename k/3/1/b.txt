# Background
# Aim
# Outcomes
  * Describe parallelization techniques at the intra-node level (e.g. based on basic OpenMP features).
  * Apply the message-passing paradigm based on environments like MPI, which is the de-facto standard at the inter-node level for parallelizing programs using more than a single node.
