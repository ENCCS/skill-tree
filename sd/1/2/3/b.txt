# SD1.2.3-B Programming Message Passing Systems
# Background
# Aim
# Outcomes
  *  the various communication modes (e.g. blocking vs. non-blocking, point-to-point vs. collective) 
  *  develop programs using MPI as the de-facto standard for parallelizing programs in distributed environments like HPC cluster systems 
  *  understand how race conditions and deadlocks may occur in MPI parallelized programs and how they can be avoided, namely by reordering send and receive operations or using non-blocking communication combined with waiting for completion of the communication operations concerned 
  *  assess the impact of communication and synchronization on the performance of a parallel program
