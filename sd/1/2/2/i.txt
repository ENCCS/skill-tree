# SD1.2.2-I Programming Shared Memory Systems
# Background
# Aim
# Outcomes
  *  assess parallel concepts typically used for shared memory systems, e.g. to exploit temporal locality by data reuse with an efficient utilization of the memory hierarchy 
  *  assess concepts like software pipelining, and vectorization principles 
  *  assess the influence of control dependencies by jumps, branches, and function calls, e.g. on pipeline filling 
  *  assess the applicability of parallel language extensions like OpenACC, and C++ AMP
