# SE-B
# Name: Software Engineering for HPC
# Background

Software engineering is often neglected in computational science.
However, it bears potential to increase productivity by providing scaffolding for the collaborative programming, reducing the coding errors and increasing the manageability of software.

# Aim
  * To apply practices and methods from software engineering that are relevant for high performance engineering

# Outcomes
  * Explain agile software engineering methods and practices relevant in high-performance computing
  * Apply software engineering methods and best practices when developing parallel applications
